                    <p>
                        I started speed skating at the age of 5. I competed at a national level from a young age, and after graduation in 2012, I began 
                        speed skating full time. After two years of that, I got to represent Canada at Junior Worlds, and I made it onto the National Development Team.
                        I have competed in China, Japan, and Norway, and I trained with the Canadian olympic sprint team for a year.
                    
                </br>
                </br>
                    
                        In long track speed skating it is difficult for sprinters to train at top speed. It takes an enourmous amount of energy to reach top speeds, 
                        and requires a lot of rest afterwards. While traveling max speed (over 50 km/h), slipping or falling in the corner is a risk. This risk is 
                        even greater due to the infrequency of max speed training. 
                </br>
                </br>
                        To counter this, we would sometimes use a sort of sling-shot machine that would take us from 0-58 km/h in a few seconds.
                        This machine would allow us to train our corner technique at max speed without expending all our energy.
                </br>
